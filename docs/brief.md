# Brief
- Looking for a new place to live is often times an arduous process. It can start out being fun and explorative but can 
quickly lose that luster and become a chore. Many factors come into play such as price, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, 
proximity to work, etc... As someone who has had to move far distances it can be stressful to have to
drive from faraway to simply find a neighborhood that suits yourself and your family. House Fax aims to take away some 
of this stress. Adults whom are over 30 years of age with children are more cautious about where they put down roots. The 
Austin Texas area is expanding at a rapid rate and real estate prices are on the rise. This is why House Fax looks to target
the subset of married adults with children who are already established in a career and make over $100k/year.

## Audience
- The primary audience would be age 30+ adults whom are established in their careers, have at least one child, are
married, and are looking to purchase or rent a property in an area that is more accommodating to raise their family.
Due to the typically higher than average real estate prices in Austin TX as opposed to
other urban areas in TX, the user should be in the middle to upper middle class income
bracket.   

## Problem
- Current real estate applications are too broad with their property and neighborhood
 information when referencing crime. They provide many details but the fact that they offer crime information is
 somewhat obscure in most applications. Many applications make crime a secondary feature
 or place it on par with enumerable other features. There are no apps with standout crime 
 reporting features that benefit from extra emphasis.
 
## Solution
- The purpose of House Fax is to give an upfront look at what types of crimes happen in an area. By allowing the user
to browse real estate data by searching within Austin TX, the user can find a property they are interested in and
view its details. They will then be presented with the overview of these details as well as a rating for Family Friendliness.
The user will also be presented with "crime cards." Crime Cards are small components that contains the name of the crime,
how long ago it happened and access to a map to view the reported location the crime took place in relation to the current 
property they are viewing. The user will be able to view the last 4 crimes that have been reported.

## Unique Value Proposition
- This application separates its self from its competition by being light weight and instead of being feature rich, will aim to one or two things really well.
It can display crime data and allow the user to view vital statistics about a particular property.
The User will also be able to view a "Family Friendly" rating. 
The Family Friendly scoring algorithm will rank the property on a 0-100% basis. 
100% being the best 0% being the worst.
   - Small scale crimes will be allotted a small score of 1-5pts for issues in the realm of traffic violations and noise complaints
   - Medium scale crimes will be allotted 10-20pts for issues in the realm of misdemeanor drug possession
   - Large scale crimes would be allotted 20+ points for any violent crimes

   These points will be averaged within a 1 mile radius of the home and that value will be subtracted from 100 and that percent will be displayed as how "Family Friendly" the home's neighborhood might be.
