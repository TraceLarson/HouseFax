# Brief

- **Audience**
    - The primary audience would be age 30+ adults whom are established in their careers, have atleast one child, are
     married, and are looking to purchase or rent a property in an area that is more accommodating to raise their family.
     Due to the typically higher than average real estate prices in Austin TX as opposed to
     other urban areas in TX, the user should be in the middle to upper middle class income
     bracket.
   
- **Problem**
    - Current real estate applications are too broad with their property and neighborhood
     information when referencing crime. They provide many details but the fact that they offer crime information is
     somewhat obscure in most applications. Many applications make crime a secondary feature
     or place it on par with enumerable other features. There are no apps with standout crime 
     reporting features that benefit from extra emphasis.
- **Solution**
    - This application will show crime statistics first and foremost. Emphasis will be put on any available data starting from the most recent occurence.
- **Unique Value Proposition**
    - This application is separated by being light weight and instead of being feature rich, will aim to one or two things really well.
     It can display crime data and allow the user to view vital statistics about a particular property.
     The User will also be able to view a "Family Friendly" rating. 
     The Family Friendly scoring algorithm will rank the property on a 0-100% basis. 
     100% being the best 0% being the worst.
        - Small scale crimes will be allotted a small score of 1-5pts for issues in the realm of traffic violations and noise complaints
        - Medium scale crimes will be allotted 10-20pts for issues in the realm of misdemeanor drug possession
        - Large scale crimes would be allotted 20+ points for any violent crimes
     
        These points will be averaged within a 1 mile radius of the home and that value will be subtracted from 100 and that percent will be displayed as how "Family Friendly" the home's neighborhood might be.
