# HouseFax
Repository for HouseFax, final project for Full Sail University.

This project will be built using the MERN stack with the following popular technologies: 

- Node JS
- Express JS
- React JS
- Redux
- MongoDB

First ensure that MongoDB is running on your system:
```terminal
mongod
```
if you do not have MongoDB installed you can follow the directions here:
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

Run the following two commands to get started, one installs backend dependencies and the other installs client side dependencies:

```terminal
npm install
npm run client-install
```

This project will include a .env file that will include my API keys. This file will remain private with the exception of the FullSail Capstone team/ Project leads. 

To start the front end server and back end server simultaneously, run:
```terminal
npm run dev
```
This will allow you to refresh on any changes to the back end and front end, this will also allow the project leads to successfully run the application in development mode.
